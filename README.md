# terragrunt-icon-analytics

This is a reference architecture to deploy the analytics platform for use with the ICON-ETL exporter in Airflow.

To perform analytics on ICON, you will first need the infrastructure deployed with this repo. To create new analytics pipelines, you will need to modify the [airflow dags](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/icon-etl-airflow) repo. Best practice would be to fork that repo, ssh into the airflow machine, and replace the dags folder (~/airflow/dags) with your fork. 

A supplemental deployment guide can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Dv2dbULjBCm3Qyt7jYekn1tTyWQV78XtPUGlrchvYk/edit?usp=sharing).

## Deploying the Stack 

The process involves four steps:

1. Setting up accounts, projects, and API keys on your cloud provider. 
1. Configure the necessary files and ssh keys. 
1. Run the deployment
1. Configure applications (Superset and Airflow)

After these steps, you will then be able to run the Airflow DAGs linked above to build data pipelines 

### Account Setup   

Before running on any cloud, signup and provide payment details to create an active account and project.
You will need API keys to any provider that you intend on running on.
For a walkthrough on each provider, please check the following links for setting up your cloud accounts. 
 
 - [AWS](https://www.notion.so/insightx/AWS-API-Keys-Tutorial-175fa12e9b5b43509235a97fca275653)
 - [GCP](https://www.notion.so/insightx/GCP-API-Keys-Tutorial-f4a265539a6b47eeb5a6fc01a0ba3a77)
 
### Deployment Setup
 
A sample secrets file is provided in the repository for your customization. Make a copy of the `secrets.yml.example` and name `secrets.yml`. Edit the file to your needs.  You are able to run a dev and prod setup.  

You will also need ssh keys. If you put a password on the SSH key, you will be prompted for it on deployment.  

```shell script
# Generate ssh key 
ssh-keygen -b 4096
```
Take note of the path and insert it into secrets.yml file for the `public_key_path` (*.pub) and `private_key_path`. 
 
##### Prerequisites  
 
To run all the different tools, you will need the following tools:
 
1. terraform - version 0.13+
1. terragrunt - version 0.25.x (not newest 0.26)
1. ansible (Not supported on windows without WSL) 

### Running Deployment

**Preflight** 

Before running the deployment, ensure that your cloud credentials are accessible to Terragrunt, either as environment variables, or some other utility (like aws-vault for AWS). You will also may want to modify various settings like DB / instance sizes before deploying. To do this, in the `icon-analytics/aws/variables.tf` file, modify [the fields in the environment](https://github.com/insight-icon/terragrunt-icon-analytics/blob/master/icon-analytics/aws/variables.hcl#L16) (prod by default) that you need. 

**Deploying** 

You will need to use Terragrunt to deploy modules in a specific order using the command `terragrunt apply --terragrunt-working-dir /path/to/each/module`.

The order you apply modules is important, with some modules being required and others being optional.

- Network 
- RDS
    - Take note of output `this_db_instance_address` which is needed by Airflow post-deployment and Superset pre-deployment.  
- Redshift (optional)
- Airflow (ETL)
    - For a VM based deployment, apply `airflow`.  For docker (preferred), apply `airflow-docker`. 
- S3 
    - Creates buckets for Airflow to push data 
- Superset (visualizations)
    - To bootstrap the database connection, the `db_instance_address` needs to be populated in the `superset/sources/database_sources.yaml` by copying the `database_sources.example` and filling out the appropriate details along with items from the `secrets.yaml`. 

For example, if you were to clone a local deployment to `/Users/example/analytics/`, you would need to deploy the network module with `terragrunt apply --terragrunt-working-dir /Users/example/analytics/icon-analytics/aws/network/`

Additional DB settings can be applied with `postgres` and `redshift-config` directories. 

##### Destroying Deployment

To destroy the deployment, simply run `terragrunt destroy --terragrunt-working-dir /path/to/each/module` in the reverse order to your deployment.
Make sure that you have activated the appropriate cloud credentials.
Also note that you are running `terragrunt DESTROY` and not `terragrunt APPLY`, as applying the module again would not do anything unless your source has changed.

##### Running Multiple Environments 

To run multiple environments, put a new key in the `secrets.yml` file like the `prod` section. Then in the `icon-analytics/aws/variables.tf` file, change the `env` field to your environment. You will also find environment specific options there. 

### Configuring Applications 

After deploying the applications, navigate to the UI and follow these steps.

**Airflow** 
- Navigate the the variables tab ()

**Superset**

For development:
- npm
- meta
    - `npm i -g meta`
    - Run `meta git clone .` at the base of the repo to clone the modules into the `modules` directory
